The problem is to cut a rope of length `N` into the maximum number of pieces such that each piece has a length of either `a`, `b`, or `c`.

### Examples:
1. **Input**: `N = 5`, `a = 2`, `b = 5`, `c = 1`
   - **Output**: `5` (pieces of length 1 each)
2. **Input**: `N = 23`, `a = 12`, `b = 9`, `c = 11`
   - **Output**: `2` (pieces of length 11 and 12)
3. **Input**: `N = 5`, `a = 4`, `b = 7`, `c = 6`
   - **Output**: `-1` (cannot cut the rope into the given lengths)

### Approach:
1. **Recursive Solution**:
   - The problem can be broken down recursively by considering three possibilities: cutting the rope with lengths `a`, `b`, or `c`.
   - For each cut, reduce the problem to a smaller rope and make a recursive call.
   - Base cases:
     - If `n` is 0, return 0 (a valid cut).
     - If `n` is negative, return -1 (an invalid cut).
   - At each step, try all three cuts and take the maximum of the results.

2. **Pseudo Code**:
   - Define a recursive function `maxPieces(n, a, b, c)` that:
     - Handles the base cases.
     - Makes three recursive calls for `n - a`, `n - b`, and `n - c`.
     - Returns the maximum of the results plus one (for the current cut), ensuring not to convert invalid results into valid ones.

### Recursive Function Implementation:
```cpp
int maxPieces(int n, int a, int b, int c) {
    if (n == 0) return 0;
    if (n < 0) return -1;
    
    int resA = maxPieces(n - a, a, b, c);
    int resB = maxPieces(n - b, a, b, c);
    int resC = maxPieces(n - c, a, b, c);
    
    int maxRes = std::max(resA, std::max(resB, resC));
    
    if (maxRes == -1) return -1;
    
    return maxRes + 1;
}
```

### Example Execution:
- For `N = 23`, `a = 11`, `b = 9`, `c = 12`:
  - Initial call: `maxPieces(23, 11, 9, 12)`
  - Three sub-calls: `maxPieces(12, 11, 9, 12)`, `maxPieces(14, 11, 9, 12)`, `maxPieces(11, 11, 9, 12)`
  - Further sub-calls are made until reaching base cases.
  - Valid cuts are found when the remaining length reaches 0, invalid cuts when negative.

### Time and Space Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**:
  - Upper bound: $O(3^N)$ due to three recursive calls per function call.
- **Space Complexity**:
  - Due to recursion depth: $O(N)$.

### Optimizations and Dynamic Programming:
- Adding an additional base case for when `n` is a single digit can reduce the number of recursive calls.
- A dynamic programming approach can solve this problem more efficiently, which will be discussed in a separate track.

### Conclusion:
The recursive approach provides a clear method to solve the problem but has significant time complexity. Using dynamic programming can optimize this solution for better performance.
