## Applications of Recursion

### Introduction to Recursion
- Recursion is a core topic in programming.
- Problems that can be solved using iteration can also be solved using recursion, and vice versa.
- Both iteration and recursion have the same expressive power.

### When to Use Recursion
1. **Algorithmic Techniques**
   - **Dynamic Programming**: Typically, the first step is writing a recursive solution. Once overlapping subproblems are identified, the solution is optimized using dynamic programming.
   - **Backtracking**: Solutions to problems like the "rat in a maze" or the "n-queens problem" are inherently recursive.
   - **Divide and Conquer**: Algorithms like quicksort and mergesort are usually implemented using recursion.
   - **Binary Search**: Often implemented recursively.

2. **Inherently Recursive Problems**
   - **Tower of Hanoi**: A classic problem often solved using recursion.
   - **DFS Traversals**: Depth-First Search (DFS) of graphs and tree traversals (in-order, pre-order, post-order) are inherently recursive.
   - **Real-World Example**: Searching for a file in a Linux system using a recursive depth-first search approach.

### Comparison with Iteration
- **Expressive Power**: Both iteration and recursion can solve the same problems.
- **Efficiency**: Iterative solutions often have less overhead. For example:
  - **Binary Search**: Iterative binary search has a space complexity of $O(1)$ compared to $O(log n)$ for recursive binary search.
- **Ease of Implementation**: Recursive implementations are often simpler and more readable, especially for complex problems like quicksort, tree traversals, and the Tower of Hanoi.

### Additional Points
- **Function Call Overhead**: Recursive functions may have overhead due to repeated function calls.
- **Programming Skill**: Recursive thinking is an essential skill for solving many complex problems.
- **First Write Recursive Code**: Often, a recursive solution is written first and then converted to an iterative one if needed, as done in dynamic programming.

### Conclusion
- Recursion is used extensively in many standard algorithmic techniques and inherently recursive problems.
- Despite potential overhead, recursion simplifies the implementation of complex algorithms.
- Thinking recursively is a valuable skill for programmers, making it easier to solve many problems.
