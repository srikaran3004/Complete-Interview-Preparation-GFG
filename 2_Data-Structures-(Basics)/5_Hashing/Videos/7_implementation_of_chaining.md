## Summary of Implementation of Chaining

#### Introduction
- **Chaining**: A method for handling collisions in hash tables by maintaining an array of linked lists.

#### Steps to Implement Chaining
1. **Initialize the Hash Table**:
   - Create an array where each element is the head of a linked list.
   - Example: An array of size 7, where each element is initially set to `null`.

2. **Hash Function**:
   - Use a simple hash function to map keys to array indices.
   - Example hash function: `key % 7`.

#### Insertion Process
1. **Compute the Hash**:
   - Apply the hash function to determine the slot for the key.
   - Example: For key `50`, `50 % 7 = 1`.

2. **Insert the Key**:
   - If the slot is empty, insert the key as the head of the linked list.
   - If the slot is not empty, append the key to the end of the linked list.
   - Example keys and their insertion: `50, 21, 58, 17, 15, 49, 56, 22, 23, 25`.

#### Search Operation
1. **Compute the Hash**:
   - Use the hash function to find the slot for the key.
   
2. **Traverse the Linked List**:
   - Search for the key within the linked list at the computed slot.
   - If found, return true; otherwise, return false.

#### Deletion Process
1. **Compute the Hash**:
   - Determine the slot using the hash function.
   
2. **Find and Remove the Key**:
   - Traverse the linked list at the computed slot to find the key.
   - Remove the key by adjusting the pointers in the linked list.

#### Example Walkthrough
- **Keys and their Hash Values**:
  - `50 % 7 = 1`
  - `21 % 7 = 0`
  - `58 % 7 = 2`
  - `17 % 7 = 3`
  - `15 % 7 = 1`
  - `49 % 7 = 0`
  - `56 % 7 = 0`
  - `22 % 7 = 1`
  - `23 % 7 = 2`
  - `25 % 7 = 4`
- **Insertion**:
  - Insert each key into the hash table at the computed slot, appending to linked lists as necessary.

#### Performance Analysis
- **Load Factor (α)**: Defined as `n/m`, where `n` is the number of keys and `m` is the number of slots in the hash table.
- **Expected Chain Length**: Assuming uniform distribution, the expected chain length is equal to the load factor (α).
- **Expected Time Complexity**:
  - **Search, Insert, and Delete**: `O(1 + α)`, where 1 is for hash function computation and α is for traversing the chain.

#### Data Structures for Storing Chains
1. **Linked Lists**:
   - **Time Complexity**: `O(L)` for search, insert, and delete, where `L` is the chain length.
   - **Disadvantages**: Not cache-friendly and requires extra space for pointers.
   
2. **Dynamic Sized Arrays**:
   - **Time Complexity**: `O(L)` for search, insert, and delete.
   - **Advantages**: Cache-friendly due to contiguous memory locations.

3. **Self-Balancing Binary Search Trees (BSTs)**:
   - **Time Complexity**: `O(log L)` for search, insert, and delete.
   - **Disadvantages**: Not cache-friendly.
   - **Usage**: Java uses self-balancing BSTs for hashmaps from version 8.

#### Summary
- **Chaining**: An effective method for handling collisions by maintaining linked lists at each slot of the hash table.
- **Implementation**: Initialize the hash table, use a hash function to determine slots, and handle collisions by appending to linked lists.
- **Performance**: Dependent on the load factor and uniform distribution of keys.
- **Data Structures**: Various options include linked lists, dynamic sized arrays, and self-balancing BSTs, each with its own pros and cons.
