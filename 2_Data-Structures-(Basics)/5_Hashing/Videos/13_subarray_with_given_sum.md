## Problem Overview:

The problem is to determine if there exists a contiguous subarray within a given array that sums up to a specified target sum.

### Naive Approach:
The naive solution involves checking every possible subarray by iterating through all starting and ending points in the array. For each subarray, compute the sum and check if it equals the given target sum.

```plaintext
Naive Solution:
1. Use nested loops to select all possible subarrays.
2. Compute the sum for each subarray.
3. If the sum matches the given target sum, return true.
4. Time Complexity: O(n^2) due to nested iteration through the array.
5. Space Complexity: O(1) additional space.
```

### Efficient Approach:
The efficient solution utilizes a hashmap (or unordered_set in C++) and the concept of prefix sums to achieve linear time complexity.

#### Idea Behind Efficient Solution:
1. **Prefix Sum Technique**: Calculate cumulative sums (prefix sums) as you iterate through the array.
2. **Using Hashing**: Store prefix sums in a hashmap along with their indices. This allows quick lookup to see if a required sum has been encountered before.
3. **Checking Condition**: For each element in the array, compute the current prefix sum. Check if `current_sum - target_sum` exists in the hashmap. If it does, then there exists a subarray that sums to the target sum.
4. **Updating Hashmap**: Update the hashmap with the current prefix sum and its index if it doesn't already exist.

#### Example Walkthrough:
Given array `[5, 8, 6, 13, 3, -4]` and target sum `9`:
- Compute prefix sums and use a hashmap to store them:
  ```
  Prefix Sums: [5, 13, 19, 32, 35, 31]
  Hashmap: {0: true, 5: true, 13: true, 19: true, 32: true, 35: true}
  ```
- At index 5 (`-4`), check if `current_sum - target_sum = 31 - 9 = 22` exists in the hashmap. It does not.
- Continue iterating until the end of the array.

#### Implementation in Java:
```java
public boolean subarraySum(int[] nums, int k) {
    Map<Integer, Boolean> map = new HashMap<>();
    map.put(0, true);
    int prefixSum = 0;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        prefixSum += nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(prefixSum - k))
            return true;
        map.put(prefixSum, true);
    }
    
    return false;
}
```

#### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity**: $O(n)$, where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because we iterate through the array once and perform constant-time hashmap operations.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(n)$ due to the hashmap storing at most n prefix sums.

### Conclusion:
The efficient solution leverages prefix sums and hashmap to solve the problem in linear time, making it significantly faster than the naive approach which has a quadratic time complexity. This approach is both optimal and effective for finding subarrays with a given sum in an array of integers.
