## Summary of Collision Handling Using Chaining

#### Introduction
- **Chaining**: A method for handling collisions in hash tables by maintaining an array of linked lists.

#### Concept of Chaining
- **Array of Linked Lists**: The hash table is an array where each slot is the head of a linked list.
- **Insertion Process**: Insert keys into the hash table. If a collision occurs, add the new key to the linked list at the corresponding slot.

#### Example
- **Hash Function**: Use `key % 7` to determine the slot for each key.
- **Insertion of Keys**: Insert keys sequentially, handling collisions by appending colliding keys to the linked list at the respective slot.
  - Example keys: 50, 21, 58, 17, 15, 49, 56, 22, 23, 25.

#### Performance Analysis
- **Load Factor (α)**: Defined as `n/m`, where `n` is the number of keys and `m` is the number of slots in the hash table.
- **Expected Chain Length**: Assuming uniform distribution of keys, the expected chain length is equal to the load factor (α).
- **Expected Time Complexity**:
  - **Search, Insert, and Delete**: `O(1 + α)` where 1 is for hash function computation and α is for traversing the chain.

#### Data Structures for Storing Chains
1. **Linked Lists**:
   - **Time Complexity**: `O(L)` for search, insert, and delete, where `L` is the chain length.
   - **Disadvantages**: Not cache-friendly and requires extra space for storing next references or pointers.
   
2. **Dynamic Sized Arrays**:
   - **Time Complexity**: `O(L)` for search, insert, and delete.
   - **Advantages**: Cache-friendly due to contiguous memory locations.

3. **Self-Balancing Binary Search Trees (BSTs)**:
   - **Time Complexity**: `O(log L)` for search, insert, and delete.
   - **Disadvantages**: Not cache-friendly.
   - **Usage**: Java has started using self-balancing BSTs for hashmaps from version 8.

#### Summary
- **Chaining**: Effective for handling collisions by maintaining linked lists at each slot of the hash table.
- **Performance**: Dependent on the load factor and uniform distribution of keys.
- **Data Structures**: Various options include linked lists, dynamic sized arrays, and self-balancing BSTs, each with its own pros and cons.
- **Implementation**: Linked lists are simple but not cache-friendly; dynamic arrays are cache-friendly; self-balancing BSTs provide logarithmic time complexity for operations but are not cache-friendly.
