## Introduction to Hashing

#### Overview
- Hashing is used to implement dictionaries (key-value pairs) and sets (unique keys).
- Provides efficient operations for search, insert, and delete, typically in O(1) time on average.

#### Operations
1. **Search**: Quickly find the value associated with a given key.
2. **Insert**: Add a new key-value pair or update the value if the key already exists.
3. **Delete**: Remove a key and its associated value from the hash table.

#### Comparison with Other Data Structures

1. **Arrays**:
   - **Unordered**: Search is O(n), insert and delete are O(1).
   - **Sorted**: Search is O(log n), but insert and delete are O(n).

2. **Binary Search Trees (BST)**:
   - **Balanced BSTs (e.g., AVL Tree, Red-Black Tree)**: All operations (search, insert, delete) are O(log n).
   - Hashing is faster for large datasets since O(1) is generally better than O(log n).

#### Limitations of Hashing
1. **Closest Value Search**: Hashing does not efficiently support finding keys closest to a given key.
2. **Sorted Order**: Hashing does not maintain elements in sorted order, making operations like range queries inefficient.
3. **Prefix Searching**: Hashing is not suitable for prefix searches; Trie data structures are better for this purpose.

#### Use Cases
- Hashing is ideal when you need efficient search, insert, and delete operations without requiring sorted order or prefix searching.
- Examples include databases, caches, and any application requiring fast lookups.

#### Not Suitable For
- **Finding Closest Value**: Use AVL or Red-Black Trees.
- **Maintaining Sorted Order**: Use self-balancing binary search trees.
- **Prefix Searches**: Use Trie data structures.

#### Conclusion
- Hashing is a powerful tool for efficient data management with key-value pairs and sets.
- It excels in providing fast operations but has specific limitations where other data structures may be more appropriate.
- Future topics will explore the applications and deeper aspects of hashing.
