### Structured Summary: Transpose of a Matrix in C++

In this video, we discuss the concept of transposing a matrix and provide a step-by-step approach to implement it in C++. The transpose of a matrix involves converting rows into columns and columns into rows. The implementation includes creating a 2D vector to store the matrix and another 2D vector to store the transposed matrix.

#### Definition of Transpose
- **Transpose:** Changing rows to columns and columns to rows in a matrix.
- **Example:**
  ```
  Original Matrix (3x3):
  1 2 3
  4 5 6
  7 8 9

  Transposed Matrix (3x3):
  1 4 7
  2 5 8
  3 6 9
  ```

#### Implementation Steps

1. **Matrix Initialization:**
   - Create a 2D vector `vec` to store the original matrix.
   - Create a 2D vector `transpose` to store the transposed matrix.

2. **Input Handling:**
   - Take input for the size of the matrix `n`.
   - Initialize `vec` with dimensions `n x n` and default values set to 0.
   - Initialize `transpose` similarly for the transposed values.

3. **Matrix Input:**
   - Take input values for the original matrix and store them in `vec`.

4. **Transposing Logic:**
   - Loop through the matrix and assign `transpose[i][j]` to `vec[j][i]`.

5. **Printing the Matrices:**
   - Print the original matrix.
   - Print the transposed matrix.

#### Example Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter the size of the matrix (n): ";
    cin >> n;

    vector<vector<int>> vec(n, vector<int>(n, 0));
    vector<vector<int>> transpose(n, vector<int>(n, 0));

    cout << "Enter the elements of the matrix:" << endl;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            cin >> vec[i][j];
        }
    }

    // Print the original matrix
    cout << "Original Matrix:" << endl;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            cout << vec[i][j] << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }

    // Transposing the matrix
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            transpose[i][j] = vec[j][i];
        }
    }

    // Print the transposed matrix
    cout << "Transposed Matrix:" << endl;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            cout << transpose[i][j] << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

#### Explanation of Code:
1. **Input Size:** The size of the matrix `n` is taken from the user.
2. **Matrix Initialization:** Two 2D vectors `vec` and `transpose` are initialized with dimensions `n x n`.
3. **Input Values:** The user inputs the values for the original matrix.
4. **Print Original Matrix:** The original matrix is printed.
5. **Transposing Logic:** The matrix is transposed by swapping the rows and columns.
6. **Print Transposed Matrix:** The transposed matrix is printed.

#### Conclusion:
This approach effectively demonstrates how to transpose a matrix by utilizing 2D vectors in C++. The process involves straightforward swapping of row and column indices to achieve the transposition. This method ensures the matrix can be transposed regardless of its size, making the solution versatile and efficient.
