1. **Structure Pointers:**
   - Structure pointers in C++ are declared similarly to pointers for basic data types. Arrow operator (->) is used to access members of a structure when using a pointer to it.

2. **Array of Structures:**
   - Creating an array of structures follows the same syntax as creating arrays of basic data types. Individual elements of the array can be accessed using array index notation.

3. **Passing Structures to Functions:**
   - Structures can be passed to functions as arguments. By default, arguments are passed by value, creating a copy of the structure. However, passing by reference or pointer is preferred for efficiency, especially for large structures.
   - Passing by reference or pointer avoids the overhead of copying large structures and allows changes made to the structure within the function to reflect in the original structure.

4. **Efficiency Considerations:**
   - Passing structures by reference or pointer avoids the overhead of copying large structures. Using const with references ensures that the function does not modify the structure while still providing optimization benefits.

Overall, passing structures by reference or pointer is preferred for both efficiency and flexibility in modifying structure members within functions.
