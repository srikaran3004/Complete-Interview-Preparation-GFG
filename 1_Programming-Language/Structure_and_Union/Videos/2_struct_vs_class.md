1. **Access Modifiers:**
   - In C++, members of a class are private by default, while members of a structure are public by default. Attempting to access a private member of a class from outside the class will result in a compiler error, but accessing a public member of a structure using the dot operator is allowed without errors.

2. **Functionality Similarity:**
   - Structures in C++ can have constructors, destructors, and member functions, similar to classes. Both structures and classes can encapsulate data and behavior within them.

3. **Usage Distinction:**
   - Structures are often used when bundling multiple items together for simpler data storage or mathematical problems. Classes, on the other hand, are preferred for object-oriented programming where data hiding and encapsulation are emphasized. The decision to use structures or classes depends on whether the problem is best suited for a purely object-oriented approach or a simpler data aggregation approach.

4. **Inheritance Behavior:**
   - When inheriting from a base class, if no inheritance type is specified, a class defaults to private inheritance, making public members of the base class private in the derived class. In contrast, structures default to public inheritance, maintaining the accessibility of public members from the base structure in the derived structure.

5. **Control over Inheritance:**
   - Both structures and classes allow for control over inheritance behavior by explicitly specifying inheritance types, allowing developers to tailor the accessibility of members in derived structures or classes.

Overall, structures and classes in C++ offer similar functionalities, but their default access modifiers, inheritance behaviors, and typical usage scenarios help developers choose the appropriate construct for their specific needs.
