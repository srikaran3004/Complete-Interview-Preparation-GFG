Structures in C and C++ allow the creation of composite data types to store multiple items together, even if they are of different data types. These composite objects can represent various entities, such as points in a 2D coordinate system, student information, or webpage details.

A structure declaration defines the layout of the structure, specifying the order of its members. Members can be accessed using the dot operator.

In C++, the `struct` keyword is optional when declaring variables of a structure type, and a `typedef` can be used to create an alias for the structure type, allowing for shorter syntax.

Initialization of structure members can be done using curly brackets or designated initialization, where member names are specified before the values to initialize them.

Designated initialization allows for flexibility in the order of initialization and skipping some initializations, with uninitialized members defaulting to zero for numeric types.

Structures, while present in both C and C++, are more of a C-style construct and may not always be preferred in C++, where classes offer similar functionality with additional features. However, structures are still used, and the differences between classes and structures will be covered separately.
