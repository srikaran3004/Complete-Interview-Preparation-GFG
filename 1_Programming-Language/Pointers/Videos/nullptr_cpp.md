### Null Pointer in C++

#### Transition from Null to Null Pointer

- **Definition of Null**:
  - In C, null is typically defined differently than in C++, often as a macro with the integer value 0.
  - In C++, null is defined as an integer value zero, but its exact definition may vary among implementations.

- **Issues with Null**:
  - Assigning null to an integer variable is allowed, leading to potential problems.
  - Modern compilers may issue warnings, but the program will still compile.
  
#### Introducing Null Pointer

- **Use of nullptr**:
  - nullptr is recommended as a replacement for null.
  - nullptr has its own type, nullptr_t, preventing unwanted integer conversions.
  
- **Example Illustration**:
  - Overloaded functions, one taking an integer and the other a pointer, demonstrate the ambiguity caused by null.
  - Passing null to such functions results in a compiler error due to ambiguity.
  - Using nullptr resolves the ambiguity, as nullptr has its own type.

#### Advantages of Null Pointer

- **Improved Type Safety**:
  - nullptr prevents unintended conversions and improves type safety.
  - Use of nullptr avoids issues caused by automatic integer conversions.

- **Boolean Expression**:
  - In Boolean expressions, null pointer evaluates to false, while any other pointer value evaluates to true.
  - Similarly, nullptr behaves the same way, providing consistency in behavior.

In conclusion, nullptr is an improvement over null, offering better type safety and resolving ambiguities caused by automatic conversions. Its usage is recommended over null, especially in modern C++ codebases.
