### Array Parameters in C Programming

#### Program Overview

1. **Program Logic**:
   - The program initializes an array with four elements: 10, 20, 30, and 40.
   - It then prints the contents of the array and calls a function with the array as a parameter.

2. **Function Execution**:
   - Within the function, the array's size is computed using the `sizeof` operator.
   - The function then attempts to print all elements of the array but only prints the first two elements: 10 and 20.

#### Pointer Equivalence

1. **Pointer Representation**:
   - When an array is passed as a parameter, it is received as a pointer, even if array syntax (square brackets) is used.
   - Array names behave like pointers in this context; for instance, `arr` is equivalent to `*arr`.

2. **Unexpected Behavior**:
   - The function only prints two elements because it treats the array parameter as a pointer, not an array.

#### Size Computation

1. **Size of Pointer**:
   - The size of a pointer is computed as 8 bytes.
   - Sizeof operator returns the size of the pointer, not the array.

2. **Pointer Arithmetic**:
   - Division by the size of the first array element (integer) results in 2 iterations for a pointer size of 8 bytes and an integer size of 4 bytes.

#### Best Practices

1. **Avoid Size Computation**:
   - It is not advisable to compute the size of an array inside a function.
   - Modern compilers issue warnings for such practices.

2. **Pass Size as Parameter**:
   - To determine the size of an array within a function, pass the size as a separate parameter.
   - This approach avoids confusion and ensures accurate size determination.

3. **Array Parameters as Pointers**:
   - Treat array parameters as pointers in function definitions to avoid unexpected behavior.
   - Understand that array parameters are essentially pointers to the array's first element.
