# Question 1
```
Wrapping data and its related functionality into a single entity is known as
```
#### Output: 
```
Encapsulation
```

# Question 2
```
Which concept allows you to reuse the written code?
Encapsulation
Inheritance
Abstraction
Polymorphism
```
#### Output: 
```
Inheritance
```

# Question 3
```
How access specifiers in Class helps in Abstraction?
They does not helps in any way
They help in keeping things together
They allows us to show only required things to outer world
Abstraction concept is not used in classes
```
#### Output: 
```
They allows us to show only required things to outer world
```

# Question 4
```
Which of the following is not a type of Constructor?
Friend constructor
Default constructor
Copy constructor
Parameterized constructor
```
#### Output: 
```
Friend constructor
```

# Question 5
```
What is the other name used for functions inside a class?
Member variables
Class functions
Member functions
Class variables
```
#### Output: 
```
Member functions
```

# Question 6
```
How run-time polymorphisms are implemented in C++?
Using Inheritance
Using Templates
Using Virtual functions
Using Inheritance and Virtual functions
```
#### Output: 
```
Using Inheritance and Virtual functions
```

# Question 7
```
Which of the following is a static polymorphism mechanism?
Function overloading
Templates
Operator overloading
All of the mentioned
```
#### Output: 
```
All of the mentioned
```


# Question 8
```
What happens if a class does not have a name?
It will not have a constructor
It is not allowed
It will not have a destructor
It will neither have a constructor or destructor
```
#### Output: 
```
It will not have a constructor
```

# Question 9
```
Which of the following functions can be inherited from the base class?
Constructor
Static
Destructor
None
```
#### Output: 
```
None
```

# Question 10
```
Which of the following shows multiple inheritances?

```
#### Output: 
```
A,B->C
```

#### Explanation:
In multiple inheritance, a single class is inherited from two classes. So in A,B->C, Class C is inherited from A and B, whereas in A->B->C, C from B and B from A called simple inheritance, in A->B; A->C, B and C are inherited from A
which is called hierarchical inheritance.
