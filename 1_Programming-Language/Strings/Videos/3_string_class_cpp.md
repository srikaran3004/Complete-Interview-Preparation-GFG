### Strings in C++

#### Recap of C-Style Strings
- **C-Style Strings**: Represented as character arrays ending with a null character (`\0`).
- Example: `"geeksforgeeks"` stored as individual characters with a terminating `\0`.
- C++ supports C-style strings, but also offers its own string class.

#### C++ Strings
- **Internal Storage**: Stored at contiguous memory locations, ensuring cache-friendliness and random access.
- **Creation and Usage**: 
  - Use the `string` class from the `std` namespace.
  - No need for additional header files beyond `iostream`.
  - Example: 
    ```cpp
    string str = "geeksforgeeks";
    cout << str;
    ```
  - Output: `geeksforgeeks`

#### Advantages of C++ Strings Over C-Style Strings
1. **Dynamic Size Management**:
   - No need to predefine the size.
   - Strings can be appended or extended without manually reallocating memory.

2. **Flexible Initialization**:
   - Create an empty string and assign a value later.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     string str;
     str = "gfg";
     ```

3. **Operator Support**:
   - Use operators like `+` for concatenation and `==`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=` for comparisons.
   - Eliminates the need for functions like `strcmp`.

4. **Rich Library Support**:
   - The `string` class in C++ offers a wide range of functions not available in C-style strings.
   - Supports iterators (`begin()` and `end()`) for algorithm library functions (similar to `vector` or `array`).

5. **Conversion to C-Style Strings**:
   - Use `c_str()` to convert a C++ string to a C-style string when needed.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     string cppStr = "example";
     const char* cStr = cppStr.c_str();
     ```

### Example Program
A simple program illustrating the use of C++ strings:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    string str = "geeksforgeeks";
    cout << str;
    return 0;
}
```
- This program initializes a C++ string and prints it using `cout`.

### Summary
C++ strings provide a robust and flexible way to handle string data compared to C-style strings, offering dynamic size management, rich library functions, operator support, and seamless conversion between C++ and C-style strings.
