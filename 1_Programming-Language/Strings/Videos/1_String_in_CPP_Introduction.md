### Strings in C++

#### Definition and Nature of Strings
- A string is a sequence of characters, such as "gfg" or "courses".
- Strings are different from arrays of characters due to their unique properties.

#### Characteristics of Strings
1. **Small Character Set**:
   - Typically involve a small set of characters: uppercase (A-Z) and lowercase (a-z) alphabets, totaling 52 characters.
   - The ASCII character set includes 128 characters, later extended to 256.
   - ASCII includes all English alphabets, special characters, and control characters.
   - Modern C++ supports Unicode (UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32, W characters), but ASCII is sufficient for most problem-solving tasks.

2. **No Separators Required**:
   - Unlike arrays of integers or floats, strings do not need separators between elements.
   - Characters in a string are written consecutively without any commas or spaces.

3. **Internal Storage as Integers**:
   - Characters are stored as integers, either in ASCII or Unicode.
   - ASCII values for uppercase letters: 65 (A) to 90 (Z).
   - ASCII values for lowercase letters: 97 (a) to 122 (z).
   - Continuous and increasing integer values allow for easy alphabetical comparison.

#### C++ Support for Strings
- **C-Style Strings**:
  - An array of characters ending with a null character (`\0`).
  - Supported due to C++ being a superset of C.

- **C++ String Class**:
  - C++ introduces its own string class, providing more features and convenience compared to C-style strings.
  - Details on the string class will be covered in subsequent discussions.

In summary, strings in C++ are special due to their small character set, lack of need for separators, and internal integer representation. C++ supports both C-style strings and its own string class, with the latter offering enhanced functionality.
